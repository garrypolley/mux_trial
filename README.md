# mux_trial
A simple repo for trying out using mux and other web server stuff in go

This is my attempt at using mux. As well as an attempt to see how doing a normal
web server would work out in go. My plan is to try out the following: 

* logging for each request
* middleware (e.g. authorization)
* handling load (maybe)
