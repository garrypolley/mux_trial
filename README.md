# mux_trial
A simple repo for trying out using mux and other web server stuff in go

This is my attempt at using mux. As well as an attempt to see how doing a normal
web server would work out in go. My plan is to try out the following:

* logging for each request
* middleware (e.g. authorization)
* handling load (maybe)

This also uses [glide](https://glide.sh/) as an attempt to try out using the glide project for
go vendoring management.
